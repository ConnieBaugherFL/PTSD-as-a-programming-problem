## Overview
This project presents a systems-based framework for understanding PTSD through the lens of human operating systems, cognitive development, and implicit learning. It reframes trauma symptoms as a **maladaptive persistence problem**: survival policies compiled during threat that continue running after the environment changes.

Rather than treating PTSD as “overreaction” or character pathology, this work models PTSD as **survival code that failed to terminate**—a protective program that keeps launching background processes such as hypervigilance, rumination, shutdown, somatic pain, and sleep disruption.

## Why this project exists
Over the last several years, I have studied traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive development, and human behavior through a computational lens—specifically, how stress responses are encoded and how “programming” becomes embedded in attention, memory, emotion, and action.

My interest in this is longstanding. More than 25 years ago, I worked with a client who experienced significant TBI, and I witnessed how profoundly neurological injury can alter emotional regulation, attention, memory, and behavioral control—not as a matter of willpower, but as a matter of wiring. Around the same period, I also observed team members challenged with PTSD symptoms, which clarified a key principle: trauma is not only a story the mind tells—it is a system state the body runs.

## Core Concept
**Emotion is a command signal.**  
In healthy regulation:

- Emotion triggers motion (boundary, exit, protection, truth, action)
- The loop closes
- Physiology returns toward baseline

In abuse and coercive control contexts, motion is often punished or constrained. When termination behaviors are blocked, the signal becomes **non-terminating**, and the system reroutes the load into other subsystems.

This is the “all systems running” phenomenon:
- cognition increases (analysis, rumination, simulation)
- vigilance increases (threat scanning, hyperarousal)
- somatic systems increase load (inflammation, sleep disruption, pain)

## Intervention Stack: EMDR + Hypnosis
This project argues EMDR and hypnosis are complementary because they target different system layers.

### EMDR: memory reconsolidation / temporal re-tagging
EMDR reduces the “presentness” of trauma memory and updates how it is filed in the brain. The event is not erased; it is reclassified as **past**, reducing trigger activation.

**EMDR changes the data.**

### Hypnosis: conditioned response + autonomic default updating
Clinical hypnosis is framed here as policy editing at the implicit layer. It updates cue → response mappings so triggers stop functioning like commands.

**Hypnosis changes the code.**

Together, these methods reduce trigger sensitivity and restore agency: the ability to orient, choose, and act without default survival scripts hijacking the nervous system.

## Optimization (Beyond Remediation)
When threat load decreases, cognitive bandwidth is restored. Many people experience improved focus, clarity, energy, and confidence—not because they become “enhanced,” but because trauma is no longer consuming resources via constant background processes.

This is “brain hacking” in the responsible sense: reclaiming executive function and restoring adaptive control.
